# Weakly Supervised Group Mask Network for Object Detection
By Song Lingyun, Liu Jun, Sun Mingxuan, and Shang Xuequn

#Introduction

Weakly Supervised Group Mask Network (WSGMN) is a framework for Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) with deep ConvNets.
1. WSGMN achieves state-of-the-art performance on weakly supervised object detection (Pascal VOC 2007 and 2012, ImageNet Detection).
2. The code is mainly written by Python.


#Experiments

(1) Conventional MIL based WSOD methods; (b) WSOD methods incorporating FRCNN; (c) Ablation study of our WSGMN.
